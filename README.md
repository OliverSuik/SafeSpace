## Project Screen Shot(s)
### Booking a seat
A student can select a session from a drop down that is then displayed in the classroom plan view. Already booked seats are colored dark gray, the current seat of the user is colored blue and all available seats are light gray. If a user has already booked a seat, they can change it by selecting an available seat and then clicking "Confirm". They can also cancel their reservation by clicking "Cancel reservation".

### Creating a seating plan
An admin can create a new seating plan by uploading a PDF-plan of the classroom and then placing seats on it. There are also functions that make this process much faster. The admin can select multiple seats and then copy & drag them as a group. They can also delete selected seats and undo their changes.

### Creating a session
An admin can create a session by selecting the classroom, time and a course for the session. Since creating a new course and a classroom everytime a session is being created would be inconvenient, the admin can select from courses and classrooms that have already been created.
